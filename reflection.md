What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Self learning python had made me think that I would be good enough to start with OOP; however the class recap was very short for me.
I think having a broader recap for the python segment would've helped or omitting it altogether because we don't work through it in java. I know, it feels like a good transition from python to java, but not for the ones who need time to process things because its too short and might leave people unsettled.

In terms of the program, applying different classes worked. But there were bugs that couldn't be solved so I had to bring the entire main into my own program to run it, because main denied to import the buy. Someone taking this course should be careful about the structure of classes.
